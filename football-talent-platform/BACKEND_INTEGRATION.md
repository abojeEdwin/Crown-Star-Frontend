# Direct Backend Integration

## Changes Made âœ…

### Removed Demo Mode Logic
- **SignupPage.jsx**: Removed all demo user creation and storage logic
- **LoginPage.jsx**: Removed demo user authentication logic  
- **ProfileUploadModal.jsx**: Removed "Demo mode" references, added TODO for real API integration
- **demo-debug.js**: Deleted utility file

### Restored Production-Ready Settings
- **Retry Logic**: Restored reasonable timeouts (10s, 15s, 20s) for production use
- **Error Handling**: Simplified to show clear network error messages
- **User Feedback**: Removed time estimates and demo mode references

## Current Behavior

### Signup Process
- Makes direct POST request to `/api/{role}/register`
- Shows clear error messages if backend is unavailable
- No fallback to demo mode - users must have working backend

### Login Process  
- Makes direct POST request to `/api/{role}/login`
- Requires valid backend response for authentication
- No local storage fallback

### Profile Pictures
- Uses base64 encoding for now (temporary solution)
- Includes commented code for proper API integration
- TODO: Implement `/api/upload/profile-picture` endpoint

## Backend Requirements

The application now requires these endpoints to be functional:

```
POST /api/player/register
POST /api/scout/register  
POST /api/coach/register
POST /api/player/login
POST /api/scout/login
POST /api/coach/login
POST /api/{role}/profile (for profile updates)
POST /api/upload/profile-picture (optional - currently using base64)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start Backend Server** - The application will only work with a running backend
2. **Implement Profile Upload API** - Replace base64 storage with proper file uploads
3. **Add Environment Configuration** - Different API URLs for dev/staging/production
4. **Error Boundary** - Add global error handling for API failures

The application is now configured for direct backend integration without any demo mode fallbacks.
